# Slade's Houserules & Homebrews

This repository contains a FoundryVTT module. This module has several compendium packs providing content from my [houserules](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MaPNOD0xPi-GmO5XcNJ) and [martial homebrew](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MrsqT6Hmo-dHFJBam4O).

Individual versions can be found on the Releases page.
